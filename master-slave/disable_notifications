# Notes: 
# 1) This script is not intended to be used as an 
#    event handler by itself.  Instead, it is used by other
#    event handler scripts (like the redundancy examples).
# 2) In order for Nagios to process any commands that
#    are written to the command file, you must enable
#    the check_external_commands option in the main
#    configuration file.
